## What is AGV
AGV stands for Auto Guided Vehicle which moves without guidance from humans and can be used in many applications.
Check this [wiki <img src="Documents/External/assets/Wikipedia-logo.png" alt="WikipediaLogo" width="30"/>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_guided_vehicle) for more details.

## Applications
Our objectives is to manufacture an AGV to help in the following:
### Warehouses
AGV can be used for warehouses logistic to:
* Get packages organized inside the warehouse.
* Delivering a package from the warehouse to a human ordered it from a GUI (i.e., Amazon store orders packaging).

## What is CLR?
### Vision
our vision is to extend our robot to be a network of robots connected together with master devices. And they are responsible for logistics in a place where they are used.
So, CLR stands for Colony of Logistic Robots. As the name suggest, it means a networks of robots responsible for logistics.

### Why CLR instead of AGV? 
We aim to use robots either on the ground (AGVs) or on the air (drones). So, AGV name stands only for grounded robot, that's why we named it CLR to stand for both applications.
